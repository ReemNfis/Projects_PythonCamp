# Projects_PythonCamp
```
I wanted my project to be enjoyable and go beyond the scope of my studies, aiming to benefit the most from the course and learn new things through the application of code. Honestly, I enjoyed it a lot and learned a great deal.
Finally, I succeeded and would like to present a brief overview of the project.
```
## p_1
```
This project includes two buttons, one for answering "Yes" and the other for answering "No." However, it's worth mentioning that the question is related to my achievement and code writing. Since I do not accept the option "No," you won't be able to press the "No" button. From this project, I have learned a lot of things, and although it took me a long time, I enjoyed the process.
```
```
Note:
The code experience is preliminary, and there are some errors. For example, when running the code, you must close the page that appears about (2-3) times until everything appears along with the image. Also, I hope that the width is enlarged enough to fit the entire screen.
```

### p_draw
```
This project was a development of an idea for a project in the "Artificial Intelligence" course.
Enjoy a fun drawing experience using the arrow keys on the keyboard. I hope you have a delightful time!
